## About the project
* The goal of this project is to develop a website that provides two distinct services: disease detection and smart irrigation. The website aims to assist users in effectively managing plant health and optimizing water usage in agricultural or gardening settings.

1) Disease Detection
The website will offer a disease detection service that helps users identify diseases or abnormalities in plants. Users will be able to upload images or provide descriptions of their plants, and the system will analyze the information to determine potential diseases or issues affecting the plants. The detection process will employ machine learning or image recognition algorithms to provide accurate and reliable results. Users will receive detailed reports and recommendations on how to address the identified diseases, including preventive measures and treatment options.

2) Smart Irrigation
The smart irrigation service will enable users to optimize their water usage for irrigation purposes. The website will integrate with environmental sensors, such as soil moisture sensors or weather data, to gather information about the current state of the soil and atmospheric conditions. Based on this data, the system will provide insights and recommendations on when and how much water should be applied to the plants. The aim is to avoid overwatering and prevent water wastage, ultimately promoting sustainable irrigation practices. Users may also receive notifications or reminders regarding irrigation schedules or any adjustments needed based on changing conditions.
